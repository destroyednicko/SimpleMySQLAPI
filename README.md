This is a simple MySQL """API""" or Wrapper.
This was done a long time ago, and the code is not optimized, and it is not documented. The language used was "Portuguese - Brazil".

Also, it contains a basic example of how it would be used, remembering, if you are going to use it, improve the code, and leave the due credits.
